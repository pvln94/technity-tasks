I have created an Amrita Online Admission Form.After filling the form and submitting it the page will be redirected into another page printing "Your Application is Submitted".I have validated the form in such a way that if we don't fill any detail of us the form will not be submitted and it will print an alert message Please fill out this place at that particular detail.And also i gave some restrictions to form such that the ph.no. should be of only 10 digits, password should be greater that 3 digits and conform password should match with password....Like this i gave some restrictions, if user doesn't fill form according to these instructions the form will not submit and gives an alert msg respective of it.😁😎
