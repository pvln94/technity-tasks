My aim is to become a Android Developer.I want to go ahead in this field as much as i can in the next 6 months and i am sure that if i got selected for technity i can progress at a appreciable rate.I also want to give some focus on academics because my parents want a good result from me.

c.How would you contribute back to the club?

I will try to work to the extent of my limits to do what the club wants from me.I would give my best to achieve something in future which technity could boast of.

d.Do you have any feedback on the selection process?

No the selection process is the best i have seen.This selection process gives a great learning experience to who so ever who attempt the tasks.I was excited to see what my progress was because of these tasks in one month so i personally find the selection process very ethical.
