I have done this task according to the instructions given.I really loved doing this task.This task is about preparing a drum kit site, and it has 7 different buttons. This task starts from the basics, i.e. linking the CSS and JS to the index.html.I have added event listeners to the button so that when any of the 7 buttons is pressed, a unique sound â€¯should be played. The audio assets along with references will be provided in the repository itself. Lastly,I have done some basic styling to the website to make it look unique and embed some attractive fonts to the site from Google Fonts.ðŸ˜Ž
